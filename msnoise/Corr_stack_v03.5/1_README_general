Corr_stack_v03:
===============
Here are scripts and programs to cross-correlate and
stack your noise data using instantaneous phase coherence.
This directory is not yet complete. I quickly wrote
some program descriptions and prepared some examples
just to show how to use the programs. In a near future 
I will improve the program descriptions, prepare some
better examples, improve the speed of the programs, ... . 

Compile programs:
=================
I use ifort from Intel or gfortran, other compiler should 
work equally well.
(1) Edit makefile (adapt the path to the sac library, ...). 
(2) Compilation of programs: (just type "make name_program")
make pcc5g 
make norm_tavg_white
make tf_pws0

How to use the programs?
========================
Just execute each program without any argument
and a small man-page will be prompted on your screen.

How to start?
==============
I remove the instrument response, mean and trend before
applying PCC to my data. I also synchronize the begin
times of the traces. 

The script "do_cpair.cmd" handles the cross-correlations
and the stacking of the cross-correlograms. You will need
to adapt the script for your own purposes/data/needs/...
At least, it can show you a possible work flow.

Note, my script uses the command "tail". It seems that
there exist different "tail" versions with different syntax 
(tail +n rather than tail -n). I.e., you may need to adapt the script.

Further, there are 2 examples which show you how to 
cross-correlate and how to stack the resulting cross-
correlations. The directories with the examples are called
Example_pcc5g and Example_tf_pws0, respectively.
Example_pcc5g/do_corr_TA.cmd and Example_tf_pws0/do_tf_pws0.cmd
are scripts which you can directly use to cross-correlate or
stack the test data. Play with the examples to get a feeling
for the programs and adapt the scripts to your needs and data. 
Good luck!

Simple test stacking some data:
===============================
(1) List the SAC data you want to stack into one file:
ls -1 mydata.sac > mytest.in
(2) Execute program with default settings:
tf_pws0 mytest.in
(3) Compare linear stack with tf-pws:
SAC> r tl.sac tf-pws.sac
SAC> p1
...

Further remarks:
================
(1) The programs are not very efficient when working with a 
large amount of data and need improvements for faster 
computations. Computation speed depends mainly on number
of data samples and lag range.
(2) Remember (see publication) that I do not use any
time-domain or frequency domain normalization
of the data when working with the PCC. norm_tavg_white.f
is provided only for your convenience and ccgn.  

Last changes:
=============
Mar 2014:
pcc5f.f ==> pcc5g.f (change ccgn routine)
Abr 2015:
tf_pws0.f ==> avoid NaN traces on input.
Sep 2015:
Started with some general cleaning. 
Feb 2016:
tf_pws0.f ==> normalization

LAST BUT NOT LEAST:
===================
Thanks for your interest in using these programs.
As usual, my scripts and programs are distributed in the hope 
that they will be useful without any warranties. So, use them 
on your own risk for your research purposes. 
Please, report bugs/problems/... .  Also, if you need any 
help, if you improved the program, if you have nice results, or 
if ...  then please do not hesitate to contact me. Any feed 
back can help me for future releases. 

If this program has helped you in your research then 
please refer to the main or corresponding publication. Thanks.
